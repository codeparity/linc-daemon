Tasks remaining for release 1.0
-------------------------------
X 1. Write classes for all application states.
X 2. Write application class to integrate application states
X 3. Accept command line options.
X 4. Use an rc file for configuration as an alternative to the command line.
X 5. Syslog support
X 6. Complete source code documentation
X 7. Write a man page

Tasks remaining for release 1.1
-------------------------------
  1. Multiple protocol versions support
X    1.1. Add abstract class VComm (version communicator) which should have
          abstract Login/Logout/Keepalive methods. VComm derived classes will
	  aggregate the SrvPxy class and use its Send/Recv primitives to
	  communicate with the server.
X         1.1.1. Throw relevant exception on exceptional response from server
     1.3. Rename all xyzMsg derivatives to V2xyzMsg
     1.2. Derive V1Comm and V2Comm from VComm.
X         1.2.1. V1Comm will remain a stub currently.
	  1.2.2. V2Comm will accept V2 authentication params in constr.
	  1.2.3. V2Comm will instantiate the v2 login/logout/continue 
	         messages internally and use them to implement the 
		 abstract login/logout/keepalive methods.
     1.3. Rewrite all CliStates to make user of VComm methods instead of
          directly using Send/Recv primitives.
     1.4. Add an option in configfile to accept protocol version
          1.5. Option should be mandatory from linc v1.1+
     1.5. Based on version option value, instantiate V1Comm or V2Comm in the 
          CliApp constructor.
  2. Cyberoam protocol version 1 support
     2.1. Decode the version 1 messages.
     2.2. Write V1xyzMsg classes.
     2.2. Implement V1Comm using the V1xyzMsg classes.
     2.3. Find someone who'll test/validate the version 1 implementation.
  3. Update documentation to reflect changes in lincrc
     3.1. Update README
     3.2. Update lincrc man page
     3.3. Update home page
X 4. Build release 1.1 packages
X    4.1. Source .gz
X    4.2. RPM and SRPM

Tasks remaining for a future release
------------------------------------
X 1. Find password encryption algorithm.
     Finished this based on code by Rahul Mittal.
X 2. Write a tool to extract configuration from tcpdump capture data.
     Ashish Kulkarni already wrote a tool called GenLincRC.
  3. Unix domain socket/FIFO based monitoring and control interface.
